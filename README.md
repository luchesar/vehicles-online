DVLA Vehicles Online
====================

`vehicles-online` is the Web frontend for disposing vehicles online, where 'disposing' implies changing a vehicle's
ownership through trade.

Architectural overview
----------------------

### Presentation layer

This project encapsulates the presentation layer of the application.

The codebase is predominantly [Scala][scala] and is implemented against [Play][play-framework]: a 'full stack' Web
framework for the JVM.

### Microservices

Most complex business decisions are deferred to a network of [RESTful][rest] microservices. These are maintained through
separate projects:

-   `ordnance-survey`
-   `vehicles-lookup`
-   `vehicles-dispose-fulfil`

These services are mocked for automated testing, but must be running locally for manual testing/development of dependant
components within the presentation layer.

Development environment
-----------------------

1.  Each project must be checked-out to the same directory using the following names:

    -   `vehicles-online`
    -   `vehicles-dispose-fulfil`
    -   `vehicles-lookup`
    -   `<<the appropriate secrets repo>>'
    -   `os-address-lookup`

2.  JDK 1.7 must be installed

3.  Install SASS. The [current documentation][install-sass] suggests:

        sudo gem install sass

4.  Install SBT.  The [current documentation][install-sbt] suggests:

        brew install sbt

5.  Increase 'permanent generation space' requirements for SBT.

    Create the file `~/.sbtconfig` with the following content:

        SBT_OPTS="$SBT_OPTS -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -XX:PermSize=256M -XX:MaxPermSize=2048M"

6.  Decrypt secret keys:

        cd <<the appropriate secrets repo>>
        ./setup XYZ

    *where `XYZ` is an offline secret key obtained through a trusted team member*

Running the application
-----------------------

1.  Run the `vehicles-online` application:

        cd vehicles-online
        sbt run

2.  Open in Web browser:

        http://localhost:9000/

3.  Repeat *step 1* for each required microservice (if any).

### Running with production logging

To emulate production-level logging:

1.  Ensure `syslog` is configured. Details have been provided for [configuring `syslog` on OSX][syslog-osx].

2.  Run the `vehicles-online` application:

        cd vehicles-online
        ./startWithLog.sh
        
3.  Open in Web browser:

        http://localhost:9000/

Session encryption
